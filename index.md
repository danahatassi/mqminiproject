My project idea, *Born to Match*, is a card-matching memory game inspired by the classic card memory game and the mathematical technicality involved in quantum entanglement.

## Background & Motivation
This idea of mine came very indirectly from when I was on the verge of crashing out over coming up with a project idea when a friend texted me on the random subject of doing a lookalike contest of another friend. From there, my mind went off on a tangent to memory games and how the game mechanic of revealing information through pairs of cards could parallel quantum measurement of entangled qubits. 


The classic memory game (a.k.a. concentration) is a simple card game where cards are laid face down and flipped over two at a time to find matching pairs. I wanted to redevelop this game in a way that could help the abstract concepts of entanglement and wavefunction collapse be more intuitive. This is why my game idea is designed to allow people to reason through the concepts by practicing recognition of quantum states and applying the Born rule to determine the probability of outcomes.

## Tools & Techniques 
Probability - Born rule


Tools: Python and likely Pygame to develop the game in interactive 2D graphics

## Goals
Iâ€™m not sure how this project exactly relates to my future, but I'm interested in studying computer science, physics, and some more math. MathQuantum provided me with valuable exposure to sectors in quantum science that I was previously unfamiliar with. Although it left me more conflicted about which path to follow, gaining exposure to so many subfields made me much more informed. I appreciate having a wider range of options to explore and research now, and I look forward to any new opportunities in my future.
