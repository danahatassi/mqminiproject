My project idea, *Born to Match*, is a card-matching memory game inspired by the classic card memory game and the mathematical technicality involved in quantum entanglement.

## Background & Motivation
This idea of mine came very indirectly from when I was on the verge of crashing out over coming up with a project idea when a friend texted me on the random subject of doing a lookalike contest of another friend. From there, my mind went off on a tangent to memory games and how the game mechanic of revealing information through pairs of cards could parallel quantum measurement of entangled qubits. 
The classic memory game (a.k.a. concentration) is a simple card game where cards are laid face down and flipped over two at a time to find matching pairs. I wanted to redevelop this game in a way that could help the abstract concepts of entanglement and wavefunction collapse be more intuitive. This is why my game idea is designed to allow people to reason through the concepts through practice in recognizing quantum states and using the Born rule to determine the probability of outcomes.

## Tools & Techniques 
Probability - Born rule
Tools: Python and likely Pygame to develop the game in interactive 2D graphics

## Goals
Iâ€™m not sure how this project relates to my future, but I do know that I enjoy implementing creativity in technical subjects in ways that I know will bring societal benefit. MathQuantum provided me with valuable exposure to sectors in quantum science that I was previously unfamiliar with. While it simultaneously made me more informed and conflicted about what path I would want to take in this field, I appreciate having a wider range of options to explore and research now.



Complex numbers are numbers with a *real component* and an *imaginary component*, in the form \\(a+bi \\), where a and b are **real numbers** and i is the **imaginary unit**.

An extended explanation of complex numbers can be found [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Complex_number).

It can be helpful to visualize complex numbers on the complex plane:

Complex numbers can also be represented in polar form as below
