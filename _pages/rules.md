**Born to Match**


**Objective**: Score as many points as possible. The cognitive purpose of the game is to reason mathematically about what measurement outcomes can come out from the collapse of an entangled quantum state, and to determine the probabilities of those outcomes.


**Disclaimer**: The cards are *NOT* to be interpreted as tensor product factors (since an entangled quantum state cannot be written as a tensor product). All joint states in the game are assumed to be entangled and therefore non-separable.


The game can be played solo or with multiple players. 


There are two types of cards in the game:
- Clue cards display one measurement outcome (a component) and also indicate which entangled joint state it belongs to, shown using both Dirac notation and, if applicable, the corresponding symbol, by default.
- Outcome cards only show a measurement outcome. There is no information on the joint state on these cards.



**Gameplay!**

The deck of cards will be shuffled and placed into rows, facing down. The deck consists of pairs of cards, one card a “Clue” and the other an “Outcome.” Players take turns flipping a clue card first, then an outcome card, attempting to find matching pairs based on the measurement outcomes and the given entangled joint state. 


When the two cards are selected, the player will be prompted to answer, “Are these cards a match?” The player is given two choices: yes or no. An incorrect answer here will result in a point loss, regardless of a correct match. 


Included in the various joint states are the Bell states (maximally entangled states, where the measurement of one qubit completely determines the outcome of the other). By default, the joint state on clue cards is displayed using both Dirac notation and the respective symbol ($|\Phi^+\rangle$, $|\Psi^+\rangle$, $|\Phi^-\rangle$, $|\Psi^-\rangle$). However, the player can optionally choose to exclude either the Dirac notation or symbols from the Bell state in the game settings for self-inflicted increased difficulty.


When the player matches a pair corresponding to a non-Bell entangled state, they will be prompted to answer (in a fraction), “What is the probability of this measurement outcome based on the joint state?” The player is expected to answer the probability of the outcome calculated as the square of the magnitude of the corresponding component in the joint state (Born rule).


If a player makes a correct match, they continue taking turns until they make a mistake (either in matching or in probability). The game ends when all cards are matched.
